### Localization

---

It is now possible to transfer this script in your own language by following a few simple steps. This steps are as follows:

- Create a copy of `lang.en.php` file in `lib/lang/` folder and change the initials `en` to your language initials.
- Change all the values on the right side of `=>` to your language and save this file.
- In config.php under `lib` folder change the file name to yours at line number 40.
- All done, you are ready to go live now :).
              
Currently there is only one language file included in this script, but we will request all our customers to share there translations with us so they can be included in this script.
